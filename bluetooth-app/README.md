# Bluetooth App (Frontend-only)

This is a minimal frontend-only React TypeScript demo of a Bluetooth/NMES control UI.

How to run:

1. cd into this folder

```powershell
cd "bluetooth-app"
npm install
npm start
```

The app uses mock connect/disconnect behavior and does not talk to any backend.
